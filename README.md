Algorithms and Data Structures
===========================================

This is a collection of implementations of standard algorithms and data structures taught at introductory CS courses.

The following principles guided our implementation:
  * Maximize comprehensibility.
  * Name as many concepts explicitly as possible.
  * Do not abbreviate variable or method names.
  * Do not use comments to explain _what_ the code does or _how_. Only use comments to explain _why_ a specific implementation was used.
  * Provide an extensive set of regression tests, preferably by employing _Test-Driven Development_.
  * Maximizing comprehensibility requires trading performance sometimes.
